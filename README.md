[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/akshayp/generator-poet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akshayp/generator-poet)

A generator for Yeoman to bootstrap a blog powered by [Poet](http://jsantell.github.io/poet/). In addition to setting up the basic directories needed it also lets you import a wordpress export file and parse it into markdown files that can then be used to view your old posts powered by Poet.

## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-poet`
- Run: `yo poet`
